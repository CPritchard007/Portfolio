After attending Tecumseh Vista for highschool, I was welcomed back to be one of the mentors. My goal was to assist the students with development of the robot using python and java. 

## The Problem
While I was part of the team in high school, I noticed a structural issue within Vista Robotics: most of the students involved in building the robot were in grades 11 and 12. As a result, when these senior students graduated, there was a knowledge gap and younger team members often missed the opportunity to learn from them.

## The Solution
To address this issue, I made it a priority to include all interested students by pairing team members of different skill levels together. This approach ensured that newer or less experienced members could learn directly from more knowledgeable teammates, helping to bridge the knowledge gap and promote collaboration across grades.
