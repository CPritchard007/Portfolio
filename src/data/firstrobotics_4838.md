Working with the students from River Rouge and the Detroit Hispanic Development Center was a truly rewarding experience. Despite facing many challenges, our small but determined group successfully built two functioning robots. It was inspiring to watch the students develop an interest in STEM and robotics, and to see them gain confidence and open up as the season progressed.

## The Problem
The main challenge stemmed from the small group size and the fact that most students started the season with little to no experience in robotics—whether mechanical or software. This lack of background contributed to insufficient leadership within the team, and many students withdrew from participation, feeling unprepared to get involved.

## The Solution
Although having a small team initially seemed like a drawback, it actually became a strength. We were able to distribute the mentors among the students more effectively, allowing us to provide tailored guidance in each area of interest. We taught the students the fundamentals of whichever roles they wanted to pursue on the team, and actively encouraged them to experiment, take risks, and think creatively when tackling the challenges presented by First Robotics.
